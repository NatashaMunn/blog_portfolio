Since @jack_edwards had only been posting for 4 years, and @cut 10 years, the greater variation in 2014-2019 can be attributed to @cut, implying that their views data tends to be more varied than @jack_edwards. This story continues when examining my other two plots, with @cut having much more variation than @jack_edwards. In conclustion, I predict this variation is from @cut being a more popular channel and having more viral videos than @jack_edwards."" %>%"
